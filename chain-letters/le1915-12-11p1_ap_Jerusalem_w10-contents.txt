An Ancient Prayer
 Oh, God, I beseech Thee, bless all mankind.  This prayer was sent to me and it is to be sent around the world. It
is said in Jerusalem that if a person would send it to nine people in nine
days that on the tenth day he would enjoy happiness, and that whoever passed
it by suffered calamity.
Do this, and do not break the chain. This is not to be signed.
