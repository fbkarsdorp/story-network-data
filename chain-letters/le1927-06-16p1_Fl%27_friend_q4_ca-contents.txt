This letter was sent to you by a
friend. Do not break  the chain. Copy it and send it to four persons within
 24 hours, to whom you  wish good luck. The chain was started by a British
officer in Flanders, and  should go round the world nine times.  If
you break the chain you will  have bad luck. On the fourth day after sending
it you will have good luck.  So please copy and send it to four friends so
as not to break the chain.    A Friend.
