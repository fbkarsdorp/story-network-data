GOOD LUCK

 Copy this out and send it to nine people to whom you wish good luck. The 
chain was started by an American officer "Buddie" and should not be broken. 
It should go three times round the world and whoever breaks it will have bad
luck. Do it within twenty-four hours and count nine days and you will have
great good luck.
