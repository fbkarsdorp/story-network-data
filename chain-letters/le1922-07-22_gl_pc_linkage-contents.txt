Dear Sarah:     7/13/22
               Good Luck
 Copy this and send it to 9
 people whom you wish good
 luck. The chain was started
 by an American officer and
 should go 3 times around
 the world. Do not break
 the chain for whoever will
 have bad luck. Do it
 within 24 hours and wait
 9 days and you will have 
 some very good fortune.
 The above letter was received
 by me and I am sending 
                     it 
on to you.
