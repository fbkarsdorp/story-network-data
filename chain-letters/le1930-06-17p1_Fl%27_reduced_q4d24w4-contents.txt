Flanders Chain of Good Luck.
  This was sent to me, and I send it to you within twenty-four hours so that
 the chain will not be broken. Make three copies and send to people whom
you  know to wish good luck.
  This chain was started by an officer. It goes round the world three times.
 Do not stop. On the fourth day after receiving it good luck will befall
you.
