Ancient Prayer
   Oh! Lord Jesus, we beseech Thee to bless all mankind and deliver us from 
 evil and bring us to dwell with Thee, Jesus.
   This prayer was sent to be sent around the world. Keep the chain unbroken. 
 Those who pass it on will receive a blessing and those who do not will meet 
 with some calamity on the 9th day.
   Copy and send one each day to friends until the 9th. Do not sign your
name.
