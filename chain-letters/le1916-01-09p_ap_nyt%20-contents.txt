Oh, Lord, I implore Thee to bless all 
mankind. Bring us to Thee. 
This prayer is to be sent all over the 
world. In ancient days it was said that 
all who wrote it would be free from calam- 
ity or misfortune and that all who passed 
it would meet with some calamity or mis- 
fortune. 
Copy it and send it to nine friends in 
nine days, and on the tenth day you will 
meet with some joy. Don't break the 
chain.
