WITH LOVE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE

This paper has been sent to you for good 
luck.  The original is in New 
England: It has been around the world nine 
times.  You will receive good
luck with in four days provided you in
turn send it on.  This is no joke.  You
will receive good luck.  Don't send 
money, as fate has no price.  Do not keep
this letter it must leave your hands in 
96 hours.  A Unites States Air force
officer received $470,000. John A> Elliot 
received $40,000 and lost it
because she broke the chain.  While 
in the Philippines, Genio Welsh lost his
wife 51 days after receiving the letter. 
However, before her death he
received $7,555.00.  Please send 20 
copies and see what happens in four
days.  The chain comes from Venezuela 
and was written by Sal Dee Croop a 
missionary from South Africa.  Since 
the copy must tour the world you must
make 20 copies and send them to friends 
and associates. After a few days
you will get a surprise.  This is
true even if you are not superstitious.  Do
note the following:  Constatino Dias 
received this chain in 1953.  He asked
his secretary to make 2o copies and send 
them out.  A day later he won a
lottery for two million dollars. 
Carol Daddit an office employee received
this letter and forgot that the letter
has to leave his hands within 96 hours.
He lost his job.  Later after finding 
the letter again he mailed 20 copies.  A
few days later he got a better job.  
Belen Fenchild received the letter and not
believing it he threw it away.  Nine 
days later he died.  In 1987 a woman
who said she would retype it and send it 
out, but set it aside to do later 
received the letter.  She was plague 
with various problems, including
expensive car repairs.  The letter 
did not leave her hands with in 96 hours.
She finally retyped the letter as she promised 
and got a new car ten hours
later in a raffle.

Remember do not send money
Do not sign this
