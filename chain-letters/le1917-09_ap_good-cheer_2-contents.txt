Be of good cheer at all times. An an-
 cient prayer. Oh, Lord ever pray Thee 
 to bless us & keep us from all evil & bring 
us to dwell with thee at last.
| This prayer
 was sent to me. Copy it & send it with-
 in 9 days to nine friends & on the 10th 
 day you will receive great joy. A 
 great misfortune is awaiting 
 you if you do not. Do not 
 send any name & date
 on day you receive this card.
