Red Cross Chain

    Love. Grace, we implore the victory of the 
   Allies.Â  Please copy this and send it to
    some person each day for nine days beginning 
    the day you receive it. Please do not break
    the spell as it was sent from Russia
    to go round the world. It was said in
    ancient times that all who sent it 
    would be free from calamity all who
    passed it would mingle with misfor-
    tune. On the ninth day you will hear 
    of some joy.
