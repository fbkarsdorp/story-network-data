AN ANCIENT PRAYER
Oh Lord! I implore Thee to bless mankind and keep us from sin, and have us
dwell with Thee eternally.
This prayer was sent to me and is being sent all over the world. Copy and
see what will happen. This was said in Jesus time. Those who did not copy
received great misfortune, but those who did received great joy.
Send to nine (9) friends within nine (9) days, and you will receive great
joy.
Sign no name. Do not break chain.
