ST. JUDE THADDAEUS 
  
   Before anything, I would like to tell you that St.
Jude Thaddaeus will help 
you in everything you encounter. Nothing in part will end to this chain
so 
give it to a devotee of St. Jude Thaddaeus by mail. In thirteen days,
you 
will receive surprises no matter how impossible.  

. The president of Brazil received this copy but did
not give 
importance to it. In thirteen days his son died.
. Senator Sola received it and sent it within 13
days; he won a 
lottery.

 This chain would be sent with five cents which will be
donated to the 
church. This was sent around the world by a priest from Columbia. 

. Exequel Arellano made 24 copies, sent it within
nine days and 
received a million dollars. 
  
. Antonio Martines received it and forgot to send
copies before 
13 days. He told his secretary to type it up, but forgot to send

them. He lost his job.

                            
 DO NOT FORGET TO SEND YOUR COPIES 
                                
 BEFORE THE THIRTEENTH DAY For the favor of the Virgin of Mount Carmel, pray one
OUR FATHER 
and three GLORY BE.  This is not a game. You will receive luck if you send
copies to your friends who need it most.  For any reason, DO NOT DESTROY OR TEAR.
 Make 24 copies immediately.  Send to your friends
and in 13 days, you will 
observe luck.
