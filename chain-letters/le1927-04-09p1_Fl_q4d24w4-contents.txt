  The Flanders Charm:
     The Flanders Charm of Good Luck was sent to me by a friend.
 I am sending it on to you, so don't break it. Copy this and send it within
 24 hours to four persons you wish good luck. It was charmed by an American
 officer, and must go around the world three times.  So don't pause,
or you will have sad luck. It is positively remarkable how the prediction
has been fulfilled.

  Send it as soon as possible and watch what will happen on the fourth day.
