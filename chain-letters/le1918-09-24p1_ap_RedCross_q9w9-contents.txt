Red Cross Chain
  Lord Jesus, we implore Thee to bring victory to the Allies. Keep this letter
 and send copies to nine of your friends, beginning the day you receive this
 one. It was sent from Russia to Scotland to go around the world. Do not
break  the chain, for it is said he who does will meet with some misfortune.
On the ninth day you will receive Â a great joy.
