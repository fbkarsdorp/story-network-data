An Ancient Prayer
Oh Lord Jesus I implore Thee, bless all mankind and keep us from all evil
and take us to dwell with Thee eternally. Amen.
This prayer was sent to me and is to go around the world.
It was said in Jesus' time that those who wrote it would be delivered from
calamity, and those who pass it be would meet misfortunes.
Those who copy it in nine days and send it to nine friends will on the ninth
day experience great joy.
Do not break the chain.
