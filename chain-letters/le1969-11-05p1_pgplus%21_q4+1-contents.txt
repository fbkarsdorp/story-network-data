The luck of this letter has been around the world four times. Â The one
who breaks it will have bad luck.

[The recipient is admonished not to keep the letter and not to send any money.]

[All you have to do, the letter states is have your secretary send the copy
you receive and four others to five friends to whom you wish good luck.]
[Then just sit back ...]
and see what happens four days from now. Do not break the chain. You are
to receive good luck in the next four days time.
