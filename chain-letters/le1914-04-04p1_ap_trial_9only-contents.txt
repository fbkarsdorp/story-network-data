An Ancient Prayer:
Oh Lord, we pray thee, bless us and keep us from all evil and bring us to
dwell with thee above. This prayer was sent to me and is being sent around
the world. Copy it and see what happens. It was said in Jesus' trial all
Â who wrote it were delivered from all evil and those who passed it by
met with some misfortune. Copy it and send it to nine of your friends within
nine days and on the tenth day some great joy will come to you. Don't break
the chain. Write nine only.
