Kiss someone you love when you get this letter
and make magic. This 
paper was sent to you for good Luck.  The original copy is in
New 
England. It was been sent around the world nine times. The luck has

been sent to you. You will receive good luck in four days. This is

no joke!! You will receive it in the mail. Send copies to people

that you think need good luck. Don't send money as fate has no

price. Do not keep this letter. It must leave your hands in 96

hours. An Air Force Officer received $70,000 in four days. Joe

Elliot received $40,000 and lost it because he broke that chain.

While in the Philippines, Gene Wolfe lost his wife six days after

receiving this letter. He failed to circulate the letter. However,

before her death she had won $50,000 in a lottery. The money was

transferred to him four days after he decided to mail out this

letter. Please make twenty copies of this letter and see what

happens in four days. The chain comes from South Venezuela and was

written by Saul Anthony Decroe, a missionary from South America.

Since the copy must take a tour of the world, you must make twenty

copies and send them to your friends and associates. After a few

days you will get a surprise. This is true even though you are not

superstitious. S note the following: Constantine Dens received the

chain in 1958. He asked his secretary to make twenty copies and

send them out. A few days later he won a lottery of two million

dollars. Andy Doddit, and office employee received this letter and

forgot it had to leave his hands within 96 hours. He lost his job.

Later after finding the letter again he mailed out twenty copies.

A few days later he got a better job!!                       
Please send no money.              
Please don't ignore this: IT DOES WORK!!
