    loving face smile upon us, let
    blessings be among nations. This
    paper was sent to me and it is to 
    go around the world. It was sent
    in Jesus time any who fails to send
    it will meet with some great
    misfortune copy and send to ten
    friends in ten days and see
    what will happen great joy will
    come to you on the eleventh day

    send no name only date received.
