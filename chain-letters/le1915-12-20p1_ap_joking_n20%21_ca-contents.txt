An Ancient Prayer
  Oh, Lord, I implore Thee to bless all mankind
  And save me from my friends
  This prayer is to be sent to all over the world. It was said by
the  ancients that all who wrote it would be free from all calamity, and
that all who passed it by would meet with calamity or misfortune.
  Copy it and send it to nine of your friends and on the tenth day you will
 meet with some great joy.
  Do Not Break the Chain
