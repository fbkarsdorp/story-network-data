A 
United States Air Force officer received $470,000. Another man received

$40,000 and lost it because he broke the chain.  Whereas the the Phillipines, Gene Welch lost his wife
51 days after receiving 
the message. He failed to circulate the message. However before his death,

he received $7,555,000.  Please send twenty copies and see what happens in four
days. The chain comes 
from Venezuela and was written by Saul De Groda, a missionary from South

America. Since the copy must tour the world, send them to friends and

associates. After a few days you will get a surprise. This is true even
you 
are not superstitious.  Do note the following: Constatine Dias received his
chain in 1958. He asked 
his secretary to make twenty copies and send them out. A few days later
he 
won a lottery of two million dollars. Carlos Dadill, an office employee,

received his message and forgot that it had to leave his hands in 96 hours.

He lost his job. Later, after finding the message again, he mailed twenty

copies. A few days alter he got a better job. Dalan Fairchild received 
the 
message not believing, threw the message away. Nine days later he died.
 In 1987, the message received by a young woman in California
was very faded 
and barely readable. She promised herself that she would retype the message

and send it on, but she set it aside to do later. She was plagued with

various problems including expensive car repairs and sicknesses. The letter

did not leave her hands in 96 hours. She finally retyped the letter as
promised 
and got a new car.  Good luck , but please remember: 20 copies of this
message must leave your 
hands in 96 hours. You must not sign this message.
