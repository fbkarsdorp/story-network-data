O! Lord be merciful unto us.
  Let Thy loving face shine upon us, and let Thy blessings be upon us.
This prayer was to me, and is going around the world.
It was sent in Jesus' time and who fails to send it on will meet with great
misfortune.
Copy this letter and send it to ten f riends within
ten days. 
 See then what will happen.
  GreatÂ joy will come to you on the eleventh day.
  Please do not break this chain. Put no name on the letter, but put the
date  when you got it.
