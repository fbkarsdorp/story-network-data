This prayer was sent to me and
is to be sent all over the world. Copy and see what happens.  It was
said in the olden times that those who wrote it were free from calamity and
those who passed it by, met with some misfortune. Copy and send to some person,
one each day, beginning the day you receive this, and on the seventh day
you will receive some blessing.  Please do not break the chain.
