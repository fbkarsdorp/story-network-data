The Good Luck Chain of Flanders
was sent to me by someone.
Send it so the chain will not be broken. Copy this within 24 hours and send
it to four different persons whom you wish good luck.
The chain was started by an American soldier and must go around the world
three times. The one who breaks this chain will have bad luck.
Notice what happens after you send it: you will be amazed at the Good Luck
you will have from this day. 
Send this to four different people.
Do not keep this. Pass it Along.
