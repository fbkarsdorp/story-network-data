Lord, teach us to praise Thy blessings
 and keep us from sin.
  This prayer was sent to me and will be sent all over the world. Copy it 
and send it to nine of your friends within nine days and on the tenth day 
you shall have great joy. If this prayer is not sent you shall have ill trouble.
  Lord grant this prayer and keep it going.
