The Flanders chain of good luck.
This was sent to my house. Copy it and send it within two hours to persons
you wish good luck. This was started by American officer in Flanders and
has been around the world sixty times. The one who breaks the chain will
have bad luck.  It is astonishing how prosperity will come in a few
days. Wait and see what happens. In four days it will bring good luck.  Send
this one and four others to the people you wish good luck. Do not keep this
one.
