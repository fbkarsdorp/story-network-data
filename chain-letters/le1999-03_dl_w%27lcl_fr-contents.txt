WITH LOVE       -     ALL
THINGS ARE POSSIBLE  This letter has been sent for Good Luck. The original
is in New England. It has been around the 
world nine times. This Luck has now been sent to you. You will receive 
luck within four days of 
receiving this letter if you in turn send it out. 
   This is no joke. You will receive luck. Do Not Send
Money. Fate and Love has no price. Do 
Not Keep This Letter; it must leave you within 96 hours. 
   A R.A.F Officer received £70,000. John Elliot
received £40,000 and lost it because he broke the 
chain. A lady in the Philippines received £7,773,000. 
   Please send 20 copies out and see what happens in four
days. The chain comes from Venezuela and 
was written by Samuel Anthes De Oroup, a missionary from South America. 
Since the copy must 
tour the world, you must mail 20 copies to friends and associates. After
a few days you will get a 
surprise. This is true even if you are suspicious.  DO NOT MAKE THE FOLLOWING MISTAKES;  Constantine Older received the letter in 1953. He had
his secretary make 20 copies and send them 
out. A few days later she won the lottery for £32,000. Carl Deddin,
an office employee received 
the letter, forgot that it had to leave his hands within 96 hours and
lost his job. After finding the 
letter, he mailed 20 copies a few days later and found a better job.
 In 1987, a young woman in California received a copy
of the letter which was in bad condition. 
She was plagued by a lot of automobile problems and expensive repair bills.
The letter did not leave 
her hands within 96 hours. However, she finally retyped the letter, sent
it out and won a brand new 
car within days.                                              
REMEMBER  -  SEND NO MONEY. 
                                                              
ALSO REMEMBER  -                                  
WITH LOVE -  ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
