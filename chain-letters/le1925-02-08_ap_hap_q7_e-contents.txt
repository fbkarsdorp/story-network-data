The endless chain of Prayer 
God bless our soldiers & sailors Â 
and keep them in the hollow of 
His Hand. 
The above has been sent me & 
has been all over the world. 
Send it to 7 different people 
& on the 7th day you will receive 
some joy. 
Copy this & see what happens. 
It is said all who send this 
receive some very good luck 
or joy. Those who pass it by 
receive misfortune. 
Send one each day, please 
don't break the chain as 
it started on the battlefield 
of Flanders.
