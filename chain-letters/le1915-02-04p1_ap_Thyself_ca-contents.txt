An Ancient Prayer
Oh, Lord, Jesus I implore Thee bless all mankind and bring them to Thyself.
This prayer was passed on to me on its way round the world, it was said in
olden times all who wrote it would be free from calamity, and that all who
passed it by would meet with some misfortune. Please send it to nine different
people, one on each day, and it is said on the ninth day you will meet with
a great joy.
Please do not break the chain.
