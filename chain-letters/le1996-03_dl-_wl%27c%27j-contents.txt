IF WE LOVE, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE This paper has been sent to you for good luck. The
original is in England. It has been 
around the world nine times. The luck has been sent to you. You will receive
good luck 
within four days of receiving this letter. Provided, in return, you send
it on. This is no 
joke. You will receive good luck in the mail. Send NO money. Send copies
to people 
who you think need good luck. Do not send money, as faith has no price.
Do 
not keep this letter. It must leave your hand within 96 hours. An RAF
officer received 
$470,000.00. Joe Ellion received $40,000.00 and lost it because he broke
the chain. While 
in the Philippines, George Watch lost his wife 51 days after receiving 
$7,775,000.00. 
Please send 20 copies and see what happens in four days. The chain comes
from Venezuela 
and was written by Saul Anthony Bogrou, a missionary from South America.
Since this 
copy must tour the world, you must make twenty copies and send them to
friends and 
associates. After a few days, you will get a surprise-this is even true
if you are not super- 
stitious. So note the following: Constantine Dias received the chain in
1955. He asked his 
secretary to make twenty copies and send them. A few days after, he won
a lottery of two 
million dollars. Carlos Daddis, an office employee, received the letter
and forgot it had to 
leave his hands within 96 hours. He lost his job. Later, after finding 
the copy again, he 
mailed twenty copies. A few days later, he got a better job. Dalain Fuirchild,
of California, 
received a copy that was fadded and barely readable. She promised herself
she would retype 
the letter and send it on, but she put it aside to do later. She was plagued
with serious 
problems, including expensive car repairs. The letter did not leave her
hand in 96 hours. 
She finally sent the letter and, as promised, got a new car. 
  
   Remember, send no money, do not ignore this, it works.
