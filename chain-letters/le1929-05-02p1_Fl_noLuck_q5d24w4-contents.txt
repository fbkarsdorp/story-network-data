The Flanders chain and good luck.
   This letter was sent to my home. Copy it and send it within twenty-four
 hours to four people whom you wish good luck. This chain was started by
an  American officer in Flanders and has been around the world eight times.
The one who breaks the chain will have no luck. Â It is astonishing how
prosperity will come. Wait and see what happens in a few days. The fourth
day should bring good luck. Do not keep this.
