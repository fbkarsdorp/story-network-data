Good Luck.
Copy this and send to nine people whom you wish good luck. The chain was
started by an American officer and should go around the world three times.
Do not break the chain, for whoever does will have bad luck.
  Do it within 24 hours and count nine days and you will have some great
fortune.
  Let's all go smiling through 1922.
