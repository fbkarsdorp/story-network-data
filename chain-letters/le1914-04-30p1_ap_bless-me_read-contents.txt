An Ancient Prayer

O Lord, I pray Thee to bless and deliver me from evil and bring me to dwell
with Thee. This prayer was sent to me and is being sent around the world.
Copy it and see what happens to you. It was read in Jesus' time, and those
who wrote it were delivered, and those who passed it by met with misfortune.
Copy it and send it to nine people, and in ten days you will meet with some
great joy. Do not break the chain; send it on the day you receive it.
