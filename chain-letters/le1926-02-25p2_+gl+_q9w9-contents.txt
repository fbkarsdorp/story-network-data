I have been sent this Chain Letter
  in order that the chain will not be broken. Copy this and send it within
 24 hours to 9 other persons to whom you wish good luck. The chain was started
  by an American army Officer and should go around the world three times.
I  don't know what for. Do not break the chain for whosoever does will have
 bad luck. Count 9 days and good luck will befall you. It is remarkable how
 many times this prediction has come true since it started. Â Keep it
Going.
