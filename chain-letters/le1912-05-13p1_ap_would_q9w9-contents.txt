An Ancient Prayer
This prayer was sent to me and is to be sent all over the world. Copy it
and see what happens. It is said in Jesus' time all who wrote this prayer
would be delivered from all calamity, and all who passed it by would meet
with misfortune. Â those who copy it within nine days and send it to
nine friends would on the ninth day receive great joy. Do not bread the chain.
