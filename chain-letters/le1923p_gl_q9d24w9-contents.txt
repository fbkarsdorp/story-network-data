GOOD LUCK. 
  Copy this in full and send to nine 
friends to whom you wish good luck. 
  This chain, started by an American 
officer, should go round the world three 
times. 
   Do not break this chain, for whoever does 
will have bad luck. 
   Do it within twenty-four hours and count 
nine days. 
   You will then have some great fortune. 
   Remember, if you believe it, it is so.
