because he broke the chain. While in the 
Philippines, George Walsh lost his wife 6 days
after receiving the letter. He failed
to circulate the letter. However, before her death he

chain comes from Venezuela and is written 
by St. Anthony Decron, a missionary from
South America. Since this copy must tour 
the world, you must make 20 copies and send
them to your friends and connections.
After a few days you will be surprised. This is true.
Even if you are not superstitious. Do
note the following: Lontantina Diaz received the
chain in 1993. He asked his secretary
to make 20 copies and send them. A few days he won
the lottery of  $ 2,000,000.00. Carlos 
Daddit, an office employee, who received the letter,
he got a better job. Dalis Fairchild received 
the letter and not believing, threw it away. 9
days later, he died. in 1997 the letter 
was received by a young woman in California. I was
very faded and barely readable. She promised 
her self to retype the letter and send it on.
She put aside to do later. She was plagued 
with various problems including expensive car
repairs. The letter did not leave her
hands in 96 hours   She finally retyped the letter as
promised and received a new car.
