Kiss someone you love when you get this letter and make magic. This paper
was 
sent to you for good Luck. The original copy is in New England. It has
been 
around the world nine times. The Luck has been sent to you. You will receive

good Luck in four days. This is no joke! You will receive it in the mail.
Send 
copies to people that you think need good Luck. Don't send money as fate
has no 
price. Do not keep this letter. It must leave your hands in 96 hours. An
Air 
Force officer received $70,000 in four days. Joe Elliot received $40,000
and 
lost it because he broke the chain. While in the Philippines, Gene Wolfe
lost his 
wife six days after receiving this letter. He failed to circulate the
letter. 
However before her death she had won $50,000 in a lottery. The money was

transferred to him four days after he decided to mail out this letter. 
Please make 
twenty copies of this letter and see what happens in four days. The chain
comes 
from South Venezuela and as written by Saul Anthony Decroe, a missionary

from South America. Since the copy must make a tour of the world, you
must 
make twenty copies and send them to your friends and associates. After
a few 
days you will get a surprise. This is true even though you are not superstitious.

So note the following: Constantine Dens received the chain in 1958. He
asked 
his secretary to make twenty copies and send them out. A few days later
he won 
a lottery of two million dollars. Andy Doddit, an office employee, received
this 
letter and forgot it had to leave his hands within 96 hours. He lost his
job. Later 
after finding the letter again he mailed out twenty copies. A few days
later he got 
a better job. Please send no money.  Please don't ignore this. 
IT DOES WORK!
