Endless Chain of Prayer
   Oh God I implore Thy blessings on all nations, soldiers and
sailors. Keep them in the hollow of Thy had for Jesus sake, Amen.
   This prayer has been sent all over the world. Copy it and see
what happens. You will be free from all care and sorrow. If you let it pass,
you will be unfortunate. Start this the day you receive it and send on every
day for seven days.
Please do not break this chain.
