Kiss someone you love when you get this letter and make magic. With love,
all things are possible. This paper has been sent to you for good luck. The
original is in New England. It has been around the world nine times. The
luck has been sent to you. You will receive good luck within four days of
receiving this letter, and you must, in turn, send luck. This is no joke,
send NO money. Send copies to people you think need luck.  Don't send money as fate has no price. Do not keep
this letter. It must leave your hands within 96 hours. A Pan Am officer received
170,000. Joe Elliott received $70,000 and lost it because he broke the chain.
While in the Philippines, Dana Welch lost his wife six days after receiving
this letter. He failed to circulate this letter. However, before her death
he received $7,775. Please send 20 copies and see what happens within four 
days.  The chain comes from Venezuela and was written by Sal
Manthony Degroug, a missionary from South America. Since the copy must tour
the world you must make 20 copies and send them to friends and associates.
After a few days, you will get a surprise. This is true. Even if you are
not superstitious, do note the following: Constantino Dias received the chain
in 1963. He asked his secretary to make 20 copies and send them out. A few
days later, he won the lottery of 62,000,000. Carlo Boddu, an office employee,
received the letter and forgot it had to leave his hands within 96 hours.
He lost his job. Delan Fairchild received the chain and not believing threw
it away. Nine days later he died. In 1987, the letter was received by a young 
woman in California. It was faded and barely readable. She promised herself 
that she would retype the letter and send it out, but she put it aside. She
was plagued with various problems. The letter did not leave her hands within
96 hours. She finally typed the letter as promised and got a new car.
 Remember SEND NO MONEY, but DO NOT IGNORE, this letter.
It really works.
