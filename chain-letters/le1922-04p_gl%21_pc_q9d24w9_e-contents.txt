Good Luck! Copy this out and send it to nine people 
  to whom you wish good luck. The chain was started by an American officer 
 and should go around the world eight times. Do not break the chain, as whoever 
  does will have bad luck. Do it within twenty-four hours and count nine days
  and you will have great good luck.
