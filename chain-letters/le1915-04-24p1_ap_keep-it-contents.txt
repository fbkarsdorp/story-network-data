An ancient prayer:
Oh, Lord Jesus, we pray thee keep us from harm and bring us to dwell with
thee. Â Amen.
This prayer was sent to me and is being sent all around. Copy it and keep
it and see what will happen. It was said in Jesus' time all who wrote it
would be blessed and all who passed it by would meet with great misfortune.
Copy it and send to nine friend within nine days and on the tenth day you
will meet with some great joy. Send no name; do not break the chain.
