Good Luck
  Copy this and send it to nine people whom you wish to have good luck. This
 chain was started by an American officer and should go three times around
 the world. Do not break the chain for whoever does will  have bad luck.
 Do it within twenty-four hours and count nine days and you will have some
 very good fortune.
  The above letter was received by me and I am sending it on to you.
