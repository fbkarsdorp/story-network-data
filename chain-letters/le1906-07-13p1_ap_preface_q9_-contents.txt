I want to you to be a link in an 
 endless prayer chain, which I have received from some sister. It explains 
 itself. The prayer is as follows:

   O Lord Jesus Christ, we implore Thee O Eternal God, to have mercy on all 
 mankind. Keep us from sin by Thy precious blood, and take us to be with Thee
 eternally. Â Amen.
