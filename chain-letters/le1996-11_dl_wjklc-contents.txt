the 
letter, he had failed to circulate it.  However, after her death
he received

The 
chain comes from Venezuela and was written by Saint Anthony DeGroup, a

missionary from South America.  The copy must tour the world.  
You must 
make 20 copies and send them to friends and associates.  After a
few days 
you will get a surprise.  This is true.  Even if you are not
superstitious.  Do 
note the following:  Constatidens received the letter in 1953.  
He asked his 
secretary to make 20 copies and send them out.  A few days later
he won a 
lottery for $2 million.  Carl Dadil, an office employee, received 
the letter and 
forgot it had to leave his hands in 96 hours.  He lost his job. 
Delan Fairchild 
received the letter, and not believing, threw it away.  Nine days
later he 
died.  In 1987, the letter was received by a young woman in California. 
It 
was very faded and barely readable.  She promised herself that she
would 
retype the letter and send it on, but put it off to do later.  She
was plagued 
with various problems and expensive car repairs.  The letter did
not leave 
her hands in 96 hours.  She finally typed the letter as promised and
got a 
new car.  Remember, send no money.  Do not ignore this letter-IT

WORKS!!
