Ancient Prayer
This prayer was sent to me and is to be sent around the world. It was sent
in Jesus' name, and all who pass it by shall meet with some great misfortune.
Copy and send to ten of your friends in ten days. Some great joy will come
to you. Please don't break the chain. Don't sign your name.
Oh Lord, be merciful to us, Let Thy grace on us shine: let Thy loving heart
be over all nations. Amen.
