Oh, Lord, I implore Thee to bless
  all mankind, and bring us to dwell with thee.
    This prayer was said by Masons in ancient times. All who write it will
 be  free from calamity and all who do not pass it on will be in danger of
 misfortune.  It is to be passed around the world at this time. Copy it and
 send it to nine of your friends and on the tenth day you will find some
great  joy. Do not break the chain.
