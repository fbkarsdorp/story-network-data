GOOD LUCK

    Copy this out and send it to 9 people to whom you wish good luck. The 
chain  was started by an American officer, 'Buddie,' 
    and should not be broken. It should go three times around the world,
and  whoever breaks it will have bad luck. Do it within 
    24 hours and count 9 days, and you will have great good luck.
