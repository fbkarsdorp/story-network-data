This chain was started by an American
officer and should go around the world three times. Do not break the chain
for whomsoever breaks this will have bad luck. Write nine letters and send
them within 24 hours. Count nine days and you will have some good luck. It
is positively remarkable how many times this prediction has been fulfilled
since this chain has been started. With success to you and yours let us go
through 1926 smiling and happy.
