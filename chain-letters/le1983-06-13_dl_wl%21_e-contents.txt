WITH LOVE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.

 This letter has been sent to you for good luck.
 The original 
is in New England. It has been around the world nine times.

The luck has now been sent to you. You will receive good luck

within four days of receiving this letter, providing you, in turn,

send it on. This is no joke. You will receive it in the mail.

Send copies to people you think need good luck. Don't send money

as fate has no price. Do not keep this letter. It must leave your

hands within 96 hours. An RAF officer received 70,000 dollars.

Joe Elliot received 40,000 dollars and lost it because he broke

the chain. While in the Philippines Gene Welch lost his wife

six days after receiving the letter. He failed to circulate

the letter; however, before her death he received 7,755,000 dollars. Please send 20 copies of the letter and see what 
 happens in four days. 
The chain comes from Venezuela and was written by Saul Anthony

De Croup, a missionary from south America. Since a copy

must make a tour of the world you must make twenty copies and

send them to friends and associates. After a few days you will

get a surprise. This is true even if you are not superstitious.

Do note the following: Constantine Dias received the chain 1953.

He asked his secretary to make 20 copies and send them out.

A few days later he won alottery of two million dollars. Carlo

Dadditt, an office employee, received the letter and forgot it

had to leave his hands within 96 hours. He lost his job. Later

after finding the letter again, he mailed out the 20 copies.

A few days later he got a better job. Delan Fairchild received

the letter and, not believing, threw the letter away. Nine days

later he died. Remember, send no money. Please don't ignore this.
